## What's up!

My name is **David Parks**. I'm a 25 year old Frontend Developer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Yes, people have computers here (and cows üêÑ). 

The first website I ever created was a music blog called Eargrub back in 2012 (I lost the domain, and have absolutely no clue what the [current site has become](http://eargrub.com/) haha). I was confused why my page was so slow to load. I mean, I was only trying to embed over **10MB** of ultra HD images, videos and Wordpress plugins. That's good right? 

It's safe to say I've come a long way, but I still have lots to learn. This website will  document my learning process and maybe help some others out in the meantime. 

When I'm not coding stuff, I'm usually somewhere in the North Woods of Wisconsin. I'm open to any freelance work, feel free to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="mailto: davidthomasparks@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a> with your vision!
